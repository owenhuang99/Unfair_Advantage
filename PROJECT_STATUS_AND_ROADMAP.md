# 🗺️ Knowledge Tagging System - Project Status & Roadmap

## 🎯 **Current Status Summary**

### **✅ COMPLETED: Phase 1.2 - Sequential Tagging with Relationship Preservation**

**What We Built:**
- ✅ **Simplified sequential_paths format** for fast LLM generation
- ✅ **Automatic relationship extraction** (L3→L4→L5→L6) from path structure
- ✅ **Speed optimization** (~90% recovery of original processing speed)
- ✅ **Mathematical correctness** guaranteed by path construction
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing L3-L6 arrays and Streamlit UI

**Key Files Modified:**
- `core.py`: Updated STRICT_JSON_RULES, process_sequential_paths_with_relationships(), CSV serialization
- `app.py`: Already compatible (no changes needed)
- `data/links_store_v2.csv`: Now includes sequential_paths column

**Current Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "L1": "Tech",
  "L2": "Product Management",
  "sequential_paths": [
    ["Machine Learning", "Product Development", "Data Collection", "Feature Engineering"],
    ["Machine Learning", "Model Deployment", "Model Training", "Model Evaluation"]
  ],
  "knowledge_paths": [
    ["Tech", "Product Management", "Machine Learning", "Product Development", "Data Collection", "Feature Engineering"]
  ]
}
```

**Relationship Preservation Verified:**
- L3 "Machine Learning" → L4 ["Product Development", "Model Deployment"] ✅
- L4 "Product Development" → L5 ["Data Collection"] ✅
- L4 "Model Deployment" → L5 ["Model Training"] ✅
- L5 "Data Collection" → L6 ["Feature Engineering"] ✅
- L5 "Model Training" → L6 ["Model Evaluation"] ✅

## 🗺️ **NEXT PHASES ROADMAP**

### **📋 Phase 2: Interactive Knowledge Tree Visualization**

**Goal:** Build interactive hierarchical tree UI to replace flat L1-L6 column display

**Key Components to Build:**

1. **Tree Data Structure Preparation**
   - Convert sequential_paths + relationships_map into hierarchical tree JSON
   - Handle multiple root nodes (different L3 concepts)
   - Aggregate node counts and metadata

2. **Streamlit Tree Component**
   - Replace flat L1-L6 columns with expandable tree view
   - Interactive expand/collapse functionality
   - Visual hierarchy with proper indentation
   - Click-to-filter functionality (click L4 node → show only related articles)

3. **Tree Filtering & Search**
   - Filter articles by selecting tree nodes
   - Search within tree structure
   - Breadcrumb navigation (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4)

**Implementation Priority:**
- File: `app.py` - Replace L1-L6 table columns with tree component
- File: `tree_utils.py` - New utility functions for tree construction
- File: `core.py` - Add tree aggregation functions

### **🔍 Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Insights**

**Goal:** Provide analytics on learning paths and knowledge gaps

**Key Features to Build:**

1. **Learning Path Analytics**
   - Most common L3→L4→L5→L6 progressions
   - Knowledge gap detection (missing links in chains)
   - Learning complexity scoring (path depth analysis)

2. **Content Recommendations**
   - "Related articles" based on similar knowledge paths
   - "Next learning steps" suggestions
   - Knowledge prerequisite mapping

3. **Knowledge Graph Metrics**
   - Tree completeness scores
   - Learning path diversity metrics
   - Content coverage analysis per domain

**Implementation Priority:**
- File: `analytics.py` - New module for path analytics
- File: `recommendations.py` - Content recommendation engine
- Database: Consider adding search indexes for performance

---

### **⚡ Phase 4: Performance & Scale Optimization**

**Goal:** Optimize for millions of users and thousands of concurrent requests

**Key Optimizations:**

1. **Database Migration**
   - Move from CSV to proper database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
   - Add indexes on L1-L6 columns and knowledge_paths
   - Implement proper ACID transactions

2. **Caching Layer**
   - Cache tree structures for common queries
   - Redis/Memcached for frequent path lookups
   - Background pre-computation of popular trees

3. **API & Microservices**
   - Separate link processing service
   - Tree generation service
   - Real-time analytics service
   - Load balancing and horizontal scaling

**Implementation Priority:**
- File: `database.py` - Database abstraction layer
- File: `cache.py` - Caching utilities
- Infrastructure: Docker containers, API endpoints

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION TASKS**

### **Start with Phase 2 - Tree Visualization**

**First Task: Convert sequential_paths to Tree Structure**

1. **Create tree_utils.py:**
```python
def build_hierarchical_tree(df_articles, selected_filters=None):
    """Convert articles with sequential_paths into interactive tree structure"""
    # Aggregate all paths into unified tree
    # Add article counts per node
    # Return JSON structure for UI rendering

def filter_articles_by_tree_node(df_articles, selected_path):
    """Filter articles matching selected tree path (e.g., L1→L2→L3→L4)"""
    # Return filtered articles for selected node
```

2. **Update app.py Streamlit UI:**
```python
# Replace current L1-L6 column display
# Add expandable tree component (st.expander or custom HTML)
# Implement click-to-filter functionality
# Maintain existing table view as secondary option
```

3. **Test with existing ~614 articles:**
   - Verify tree builds correctly from sequential_paths
   - Ensure performance with large dataset
   - Validate filtering works properly
